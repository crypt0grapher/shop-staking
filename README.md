# SHOP Staking Contract

Stake $SHOP to get a revenue share generated by $SHOP Token taxes in ETH

Once one stakes N $SHOP they got N $xSHOP from the staking contract.
The rewards are generated due to a snapshot of Revenue Share Wallet taken every epoch (which is 24 hours currently, the snapshot is taken at midnight UTC).
The baseline formula is pretty straightforward:
The amount of revenue share one gets = (Staked $SHOP by the staker / Total staked $SHOP) x Revenue Share Wallet fees.

There's an option to turn on auto compounding that swaps earned revenue share in ETH into $SHOP and re-stakes the generated $SHOP rewards. This happens every epoch right after the rewards distribution.

In reality, the algorithm is more complex since it accounts for the time of staking, earlier distributed rewards, and earlier paid fees.
The algorithm is completely transparent and sealed in the staking contract ready to be verified by anyone.
The revenue is collected at midnight (00:01  UTC) on Revenue Share Wallet which everyone can check.
Then, 23:59 later at 00:00 UTC, the snapshot of staked tokens is taken - the amount of the staked $SHOP for every participant and the total stake, and this is available to be claimed immediately.

Let's consider a few examples with increasing complexity to illustrate that.
A participant stakes 20K $SHOP on 4 Sep without auto-compounding, then claims on 5 Sep.
Fees generated on 2 Sep were 1 ETH, so starting from 00:01 on 3 they are on the revenue wallet.
On 4 Sep the snapshot is taken, and the total stake is 100K $SHOP.
Once the participant claims, they got 1 ETH X 20K/100K = 0.2 ETH.

A participant stakes 20K $SHOP on 4 Sep without auto-compounding, then stakes 1000 $SHOP on 5 Sep, unstakes (withdraws) 2000 $SHOP on 6 Sep, and claims on 7 Sep.
Fees generated by the token: 1 ETH on 2 Sep (claimable 4 Sep), 2 ETH on 3 and 4 Sep (claimable 5 and 6 Sep)
On 5 Sep snapshot, the total stake is 120 $SHOP and on 6 Sep it's 160 Shop
Once the participant claims, they got 1 ETH X 20K/100K + 2 ETH X 21K/120K  + 2 ETH x 19K/160K= 0.2 + 0.35 + 0.2375 = 0.7875 ETH.

Now with autocompounding, a participant stakes 20K $SHOP on 4 Sep with auto-compounding and claims on 6 Sep.
The price of $SHOP at midnight UTC on 5th Sep is 0.000005 WETH
Then once the snapshot is taken on 5th Sep, the 0.2 ETH is swapped into 40K $SHOP,  and it is staked automatically.
Then next day midnight, on the 6th when the snapshot is taken it accounts thouse amounts, and during the day the user is able to  claim:
1 ETH X 20K/100K + 2 ETH X 21K/120K +  2 ETH x (19K+40K)/(160K+40K) =  0.2 + 0.35 + 0.59 =  1.14 ETH
